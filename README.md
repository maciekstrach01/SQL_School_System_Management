# Database of the middle school

The project includes the construction of a basic database designed to store information necessary for the operation of a school, created with a secondary school (technical school, high school, trade school) in mind. It initially consists of 10 tables designed to contain data on: pupils, teachers, classes, subjects, grades, activities, classrooms, parents of pupils. The data base was standardised as far as possible. 
The following assumptions were made for simplicity: 
No two teachers with the same name, parents have the same address as their child, we do not plan substitutions in the database, there are no grades with plus or +/- type.
